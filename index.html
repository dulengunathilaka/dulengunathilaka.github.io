        <h2>My Liking for Coding </h2>

            designing websites, or solving programming challenges, I enjoy turning creativity into
            something real. My goal is to become a computer engineer and build innovative technology

        <h2>Sports & Strategy </h2>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, I play cricket and soccer, which teach me teamwork, discipline,
            and leadership. I also enjoy playing Brawl Stars, where strategy, fast thinking,
            and decision-making are key skills.
